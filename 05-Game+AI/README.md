# Game + AI

The goal of this Hackathon was it to code a simple game like tic tac toe, 2048, Minesweeper or connect four and to create some kind of AI to master that game.

# General idea

I think I want to create an AI that is based on machine learning and is able to learn games like connect four and tic tac toe all by itself.
I want the AI to play against itself to get better. To the AI it shouldn't matter how big the tic tac toe field is. 
I just want to code the rules and the logic of the game and the AI will go for it.
