# Coding-Projects

This Repository contains all the coding projects I stumbled upon in my everyday life or that I created at Hackathons or Game Jams in which I participated. Many aren't finished at all or just a total mess. Some on the other hand are cool. There are just my everyday small projects. I usually don't put a lot of effort into these but hope they still might be usefull for some people.

:green_circle:: I got at least some kind of a working version done but I am probably not happy with it. There are always a billion things to do better. At this point I just stoped working on it.  
:red_circle:: Neither finished nor am I working on it...
