# Coding-Projects

This Repository contains all the coding projects I stumbled upon in my everyday life or that I created at Hackathons or Game Jams in which I participated.
Many aren't finished at all and a total mess even I don't understand. Some on the other hand are cool.

## Status

- ✅ I got at least some kind of a working version done but I am probably not happy with it. There are always a billion things to do better. At this point I just stoped working on it.
- ♾️ Work in progress... Probably for ever...
- ⛔ Neither finished nor am I working on it...
