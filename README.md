# Coding-Projects

This Repository contains most of the coding projects I stumbled upon in my everyday life or that I created at Hackathons or Game Jams in which I participated. Many aren't finished at all or just a total mess. Some on the other hand are cool. They are just my everyday small projects. I usually don't put a lot of effort into these but hope they still might be usefull for some people. Also many of these projects are pretty old. Most of the code here is pretty horrible. Following the [Cult of Done/Done Manifesto](https://youtu.be/bJQj1uKtnus) I still consider them done. I could spend hours making everything fancy and performent with all the knowledge I gained in the time but that would just be a waste of time.
