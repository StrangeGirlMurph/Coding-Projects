# Music visualizer

Hackathon creating a music visualizer

Ideas:
- something like oscilloscopes
- something in the terminal
- maybe something with arduinos and hardware

## Usage

### Getting started
1. install the packages used in `music_visualizer.py`
2. edit `SONG` to be the path to your song
3. choose in the main function which visualizer you want to use by default
4. run and have fun ;)

### Keyboard
- ``ESC`` to close the program
- ``SPACE`` to pause and resume

Press these letters to change the visualizer on the flow
- ``r`` for RECTANGLE
- ``c`` for CIRCLE
- ``o`` for CIRCLE_OUTLINE
- ``l`` for LINE
- ``p`` for POINT_GRAPH (actually this one is kinda broke but I don't wanna fix it)
- ``g`` for LINE_GRAPH
- ``k`` for KLEIN_BOTTLE
